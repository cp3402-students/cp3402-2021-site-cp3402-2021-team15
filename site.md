# Further develop the site using worpress
If new content needs to be added or altered a few approaches could be put into use as long as the developers are careful not to corrupt the database with conflicting or contending push requests. The website can be edited offline in a development environment using Wordpress in combination of with some form of stack for local development. Xampp is recommended  as that is what the team used.

# How to develop locally without database curruption
When it comes to sharing the development process github was employed and used to save changes to the site as well as provide the version control. If a developer wishes to edit the site they must pull the repository into their local environment by copying the wordpress folder of the website into the 'htdocs' folder in Xampp.  The developer can then start the Apache server and mysql on the Xampp controller.The developer must then import the new version of the website database into phpmyadmin to ensure the database matches the version of the site. Now the website is ready to edit locally in Wordpress.
